1) Jeneral Explaination about the project:
The project is a code in IntellJ that behaves as the terminal behaves, it uses some commands with a certain, appropriate functions, each of them work depend on each of the commands. So, in other words, the user can use this code in order to implement some terminal's operations, such as, create a directory, create a file, list the content of each of them and more. It contains two classes, the first which called MiniShell that behaves as the main class, and the second called SellCommandHandler which contains the functions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) How to compile and run the code: 
I opened IntellJ and opened two classes, MiniShell and ShellCommandHandler. In the first I used Scanner library, an object from Scanner class, an object from SellCommandHandler calss, while loop, and if statements. in the second one, I used java.io.File and java.io.IOException libraries, I used a variable its name is (currentDirectory) which have the Private, File data types. Also I used many functions which are: ShellCommandHandler() , printWorkingDirectory() , listDirectory() , changeDirectory(String name) , makeDirectory(String name) , createFile(String name) , printHelp() , getCurrentDirectory(). In order to run the code, the user have to write the name of the command and the name of the file or the directory that he wants by using an array, the compiler examines the required, and calls the apprpriate function and gives the output.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) An example for an output:
The user will read a welcome statement which is ( Welcome to MiniShell! Type 'help' for a list of commands. ), then he writes the name of the command, for example ls command, the job of this command is to list the content of a file or a directory ( according to what the user wants ). In this case, the compiler will call the function that does the same job of this command which called listDirectory(), this function will check if the file or the directory not null and it has a length, then it shows a messege for the user which is ( Files and directories in: " + currentDirectory.getAbsolutePath() ) which shows the path, then uses a for loop in order to list the content by checking if the user wants to implement this command on a file or a directory, if he wants to list file's content the function will shows its content ( [FILE] " + file.getName() ), if it is a directory, it will show its content ( [DIR ] " + file.getName() ), if it is not recognized it will show ( [UNKW] " + file.getName() ).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Explaination for the functions:
- ShellCommandHandler() : we use it for initializing currentDirectory to the user's current working directory, Gets the current directory by using getProperty(), then create an object its name currentDirectory from File class.
- printWorkingDirectory() : we use it for printing the absolute path of the current directory.
- listDirectory() : we use it for listing all files and directories in the current directory, we create an array that have File data type, check if the file or the directory is not null, and has a length, then use for loop in order to list the content, check if it's a file or a directory, if it is a directory then it will list the content of the directory, but if it's a file, it will list its content, if it is not recognized it will show for the user that it's unknown file. If it is null or not has a length, it will tell the user that it's empty or can not be accessed.
- changeDirectory(String name) : Implement the change directory command, we create a variable it name currentDirectory which is private and has a File data type, its value System.getProperty("user.dir") which is shows the entire path for the user, check if the name that the user wrote is null or has spaces, or empty, it will show usage message: "Usage: cd [directory_name]". IF the name is (..) it will move to parent directory if possible, we create an object from File class its name parent and its value currentDirectory.getParentFile(), check if it's not null and exists, then the value of variable currentDirectory will be the value of parent. But if it's null it will show for the user ( "Already at the root directory. Cannot move up." ). If the name isn't (..) then it will create an object that its name newDir from File class, check if it exists and it is a directory then the value of currentDirectory will be the value of newDir. If directory doesn't exist, it will print error message: "Directory not found: [name]".
- makeDirectory(String name) : Implement the make directory command, we create a variable its name currentDirectory which is private and has a File data type, its value System.getProperty("user.dir") which is shows the entire path for the user, check if the name that the user wrote is null or has spaces, or empty, it will show usage message: "Usage: mkdir [directory_name]". create an object that its name newDir from File class, ckeck if it exists, then check if it's a directory, If directory already exists, it will print "Directory already exists.", if it's a file, it will print "A file with that name already exists". then we check If directory creation is successful by using mkdir() function, it will print: "Directory created: [name]". If directory creation fails, it will print "Failed to create directory."
- createFile(String name) : Implement the create file command, we create a variable it name currentDirectory which is private and has a File data type, its value System.getProperty("user.dir") which is shows the entire path for the user, check If name is null, show usage message: "Usage: touch [file_name]". create an object that its name newFile from File class, we check if it is a file and exists, it will print: "File already exists.". if it is not a file it will print "A directory with that name already exists.". If file creation is successful by using createNewFile() function, it will print: "File created: [name]". if it fails it will print "Failed to create file.". If file creation fails, it will print error message with exception details.
- printHelp() : Implement help command to print information about all available commands, and list all commands with their descriptions such as ( cd [directory_name], mkdir [directory_name], touch [file_name], ls, pwd, help, exit ).
- getCurrentDirectory() : A function that has been created to return the current directory.
